## Pseudocode Explanation for a Basic RAG System

This code is not an actual executable code but a **pseudocode** designed to explain the concept of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Pseudocode is a means to express the basic flow of algorithms and programs without being bound by the specific syntax of programming languages. Below is a step-by-step explanation of each part of this pseudocode in English.

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Pseudocode

#### Class Definition: RetrievalAugmentedGenerator
- This class represents the RAG system.
- In the `__init__` method (constructor), it initializes the system with a retrieval system (`retrieval_system`) and a language model (`language_model`).

#### Method: generate_response
- This method generates a response to a user's query (`query`).
- First, it uses `retrieval_system.retrieve(query)` to fetch relevant documents.
- Next, it combines the query and the retrieved documents using the `_combine_query_and_docs` method.
- Finally, it uses `language_model.generate(combined_input)` to generate a response from the combined input.

#### Method: _combine_query_and_docs
- This private method is used for combining the query and the retrieved documents.
- Here, it simply concatenates the query and documents as strings.

#### Example Usage
- `YourRetrievalSystem()` and `YourLanguageModel()` are parts that would need actual implementation. As this is pseudocode, specific implementations are not included.
- An example is shown where the query `"What is the best programming language for AI?"` is used to generate a response from the RAG system.

This pseudocode is meant to aid in understanding the basic structure of a RAG system and is not executable as real code. Implementing this requires appropriate knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and programming languages.
